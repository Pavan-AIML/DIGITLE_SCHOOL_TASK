<h1>Building a regression prediction model for the number of deaths in a given month and year </h1>
<h2> To build this application twe will use feed forward Neural network with the output node number of accidents. </h2>
<h3> HTTP methods (Hypertext transfer protocol ). They are famous 4 methods called verbs.</h3>

- Client communicates with the server using http requests. 
<h4> Following are the HTTP verbs used by the rest API. </h4>


- Get -> Read the data from server (To read URI).
- Post -> To create the data.
- Put -> To update the data.
- Delete -> To delete the data.



<h1> In this section we will see what we have used to deploy the model in streamlit </h1>

- Creating the stramlit dashboard.
- Creating the dash board that takes the input data as year and months.
- Then predicting the number of deths in that year and month.
